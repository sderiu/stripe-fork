public protocol PaymentIntentsRoutes {
    /// Creates a PaymentIntent object.
    ///
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - amount: A positive integer representing how much to charge in the smallest currency unit (e.g., 100 cents to charge $1.00 or 100 to charge ¥100, a zero-decimal currency). The minimum amount is $0.50 US or equivalent in charge currency.
    ///   - currency: Three-letter ISO currency code, in lowercase. Must be a supported currency.
    ///   - applicationFeeAmount: The amount of the application fee (if any) that will be applied to the payment and transferred to the application owner’s Stripe account. For more information, see the PaymentIntents Connect usage guide.
    ///   - captureMethod: Capture method of this PaymentIntent, one of `automatic` or `manual`.
    ///   - confirm: Set to `true` to attempt to confirm this PaymentIntent immediately. This parameter defaults to `false`. If the payment method attached is a card, a return_url may be provided in case additional authentication is required.
    ///   - confirmationMethod: One of `automatic` (default) or `manual`. /n When the confirmation method is `automatic`, a PaymentIntent can be confirmed using a publishable key. After `next_actions` are handled, no additional confirmation is required to complete the payment. /n When the confirmation method is` manual`, all payment attempts must be made using a secret key. The PaymentIntent will return to the `requires_confirmation` state after handling `next_actions`, and requires your server to initiate each payment attempt with an explicit confirmation. Read the expanded documentation to learn more about manual confirmation.
    ///   - customer: ID of the customer this PaymentIntent is for if one exists.
    ///   - description: An arbitrary string attached to the object. Often useful for displaying to users. This will be unset if you POST an empty value.
    ///   - metadata: Set of key-value pairs that you can attach to an object. This can be useful for storing additional information about the object in a structured format.
    ///   - onBehalfOf: The Stripe account ID for which these funds are intended. For details, see the PaymentIntents Connect usage guide.
    ///   - paymentMethod: ID of the payment method to attach to this PaymentIntent.
    ///   - paymentMethodTypes: The list of payment method types that this PaymentIntent is allowed to use. If this is not provided, defaults to `[“card”]`. Valid payment method types include: `card` and `card_present`.
    ///   - receiptEmail: Email address that the receipt for the resulting payment will be sent to.
    ///   - savePaymentMethod: Set to `true` to save the PaymentIntent’s payment method (either `source` or `payment_method`) to the associated customer. If the payment method is already attached, this parameter does nothing. This parameter defaults to `false` and applies to the payment method passed in the same request or the current payment method attached to the PaymentIntent and must be specified again if a new payment method is added.
    ///   - shipping: Shipping information for this PaymentIntent.
    ///   - source: ID of the Source object to attach to this PaymentIntent.
    ///   - statementDescriptor: Extra information about a PaymentIntent. This will appear on your customer’s statement when this PaymentIntent succeeds in creating a charge.
    ///   - transferData: The parameters used to automatically create a Transfer when the payment succeeds. For more information, see the PaymentIntents Connect usage guide.
    ///   - transferGroup: A string that identifies the resulting payment as part of a group. See the PaymentIntents Connect usage guide for details.
    /// - Returns: A `StripePaymentIntent`.

If payment fails, the PaymentIntent will transition to the `requires_payment_method` status. If payment succeeds, the PaymentIntent will transition to the `succeeded` status (or `requires_capture`, if `capture_method` is set to `manual`). /n If the `confirmation_method` is `automatic`, payment may be attempted using our client SDKs and the PaymentIntent’s client_secret. After `next_action`s are handled by the client, no additional confirmation is required to complete the payment. /n If the `confirmation_method` is `manual`, all payment attempts must be initiated using a secret key. If any actions are required for the payment, the PaymentIntent will return to the `requires_confirmation` state after those actions are completed.
